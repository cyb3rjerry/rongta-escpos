# Rongta RP325/RP326/RP327/RP328 command set

## WARNING

This repo is VERY MUCH work in progress. Unimplemented functions WILL panic. This lib is prone to change.

## Purpose

I'm intending on working on a wack printer project and quickly discovered ESC/POS is somewhat of a mess. Most implementations of the "protocol" are vendor specific despite offering similarities. This repo aims at implementing the Rongta RP325/RP326/RP327/RP328 command set.

The command set is implemented based off [this manual](https://www.manualslib.com/manual/3423402/Rongta-Technology-Rp325.html) which is everything but great. My guess is it's been translated from some language (chinese maybe?) to english using the shittiest and first translator software someone at Rongta could find.

## Kanjis

Kanjis are currently unsupported by this library
